# portfolio_mattt_kvls
This is my portfolio. To create it I have used :
  •  media queries and float grid for a responsive design on all devices.  
	• compression tools to reduced img sizes for better performance.
	• validation tools so my html code is valid.
	• animation library Animate.css but I have also created my own animations with @keyframes or transform/ transition properties.
  • jQuery Plugins to select and manipulate elements/ to add waypoints and scrolling effects
